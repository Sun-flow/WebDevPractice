            I'm not so good at gifts or making things
            <br>
            and I don't think buying you something really conveys
            <br>
            how much 
            <br>
            I care about you
            <br>
            <br> 
            
            so instead I made a stupid thing to tell you I think you're neat
            <br>
            <br>

            Without furthur ado, here are many things that are cool about you
