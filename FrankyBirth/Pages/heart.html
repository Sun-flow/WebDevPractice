        <p>
            You are one of, if not the, most special people I have ever met.
            <br>
            I know I say this often, 
            <br>
            but your ability to enrich my life and the lives of those you touch
            <br>
            never ceases to amaze me
            <br>
            You make me stronger, happier, and kinder every time our minds touch
            <br>
            You make me feel beautiful, soft, and cared for every time our bodies touch
            <br>
            I hope for each of your days to be wonderful and full of meaning
            <br>
            And that I get to spend many more of them with you
            <br><br><br>
            So, now that I'm done being gay, look at all the fun we've had lately!
